title: Project Benson - Optimize Marketing Strategies using NYC Subway Data
---

This is the first project for the Metis Data Science bootcamp. Our client, WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY), an organization that aims at building an inclusive community and increasing participation for women in technology related industries, is seeking help to promote their annual gala event.

Even though we were given a fairly short timeline (1 week), we managed to capture the essence of data science projects from start to end. Below is an overview of the steps we took:

Understand the Problem and Objectives
Scrap the Data
Wrangle the Data
Analyze the Data
Visualize and Present Findings


Understand the Problem and Objectives
